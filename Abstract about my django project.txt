              HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
ABSTRACT:-
                     In this hospital management i am going to create a web-based 
platform from where everyone can get service provided br the hospitals. 
The main aim to create this is any business that does not have a software 
application is missing one of the most powerful time saving tool available 
to them. In these days most of the business organizations uses a desktop or 
web-based or a mobile app for management of records. For this reason of 
dependency on software application, we develop a desktop application for 
hospital in which administartor and patient can get a convenient 
environment for various services. Usually,the client uses MS Excel or 
paper, and maintains their records, however it is not possible them to share
the data from multiple system in multi user environment , there is a lot of 
duplicate work, and chance to mistakes. When the record are changed they 
need to update each and every excek file. This hotel management eliminates
 most of these problems by updating or deleting by the admin an individual 
records. Hence this hospital management increases an efficiency and 
effectiveness, automation, user-friendly interface, information availability,
 communication capacity , maintainance, cost reduction makes our system 
smarter than before.
